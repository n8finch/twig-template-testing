# Templating Lecture

## What is templating?

- 

## Why use templating?

- Partials
- Avoid repetition
- Escaping (late!) ("When working with data, validate and sanitze early, escape late.")
- Use other people's code (efficiency, security, code sharing so others know what you're doing)


## How is templating used in:

- WordPress (template tags and conditionals, escaping data, could talk about validating and sanitizing as well)
- Symfony (Twig)
- Laravel (Blade)
- Handlebars, Mustache, Pug, etc.
